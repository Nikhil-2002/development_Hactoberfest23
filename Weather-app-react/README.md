### Project Details

This is a Weather app developed using React js and Material UI 
Integrated OpenWeatherMap API for current weather Data.
On the Home screen you can search for weather using city name. The default temperature unit is in Celsius, however you can toggle it to Fahranheit unit using the icon next to search bar. You can view current weather description, wind speed, pressure, minimum and maximum temperature, sunset and sunrise time of that particular city.

Apart from current weather, you can view forecast for the next 5 days also.

An area chart is included for visualising wind speed for that day. 

Included react-hot-toast for toast messages.
